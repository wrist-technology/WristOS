  \page dataformats Data Formats & Protocols
  
  \section OSC
  The Make Controller has great support for OSC (Open Sound Control).  Don't let the name fool you - 
  OSC is not actually audio-specific, but is a nice general data format and is widely supported
  in most programming environments.  Most systems on the Make Controller are exposed via OSC
  so they can be controlled remotely, giving you the option to write & run your program on your laptop
  instead of on the Make Controller directly.
  
  \section JSON
  The Make Controller also has great support for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).  Many web services
  exchange information in the JSON format, and you can work with it seamlessly on the Make Controller.
  Check the JsonEncoder and JsonDecoder classes for more info.
  
  \section base64 Base 64
  If you need to encode or decode any data as base 64 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) then check out
  the Base64 class.  This is often handy for transmitting binary data through text-based formats like XML
  or JSON.
  
  \section AES
  If you need to encrypt your data, such that only those with the password can decipher it, check out the
  Aes class.  AES is such a strong cipher that it's certified for use by the National Security Agency!
