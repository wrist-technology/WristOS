  \page interfacing Interface Options
 
  \section Overview
  The Make Controller has a great variety of peripherals that make it easy to 
  interface with other devices.
  
  \section USB
  The Make Controller has USB 2.0 'full speed' support and can act as a virtual serial
  port, making it easy to connect to your desktop or laptop for reading and writing.
  Check the UsbSerial class for more info.
  
  Note - The Make Controller also has the capacity to present itself as different USB devices,
  but the virtual serial port is the only one we have firmware support for at the moment.
  In the future we may be able to take advantage of HID and Mass Storage interfaces.
  
  \section Serial
  There are 2 full UART/serial ports available, each with hardware handshaking capabilities, and
  a third 'debug' port with no hardware handshake.  The Serial class provides support for the
  2 full serial ports.
  
  \section SPI
  The Make Controller has 4 SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) channels, but only 2 are available
  for general use, due to the use of signals on the Controller Board.  Check the Spi class for
  more details.
  
  \section TWI
  The Make Controller has a TWI interface, but there's not much firmware support at the moment.
  Patches gladly accepted!
  
  \section CAN
  The Make Controller has a CAN interface but, as with TWI, there's not much firmware support at the moment.
  Patches also gladly accepted!
