  \defgroup io Input / Output
  
  \section ains Analog Inputs
  The Make Controller has 8 10-bit analog inputs.  Check the AnalogIn class for more details.
  
  \section raw_io IO Lines
  The Make Controller provides up to 35 digital IO lines that can be configured as inputs or outputs.
  Check the Io class for controlling these signal lines.
  
  \section Motors
  The Pwm class provides the most direct control of the pwm signals on the Make Controller, and 
  the Stepper, Servo and Motor classes make it easy to control stepper, servo and dc motors.
  
  \section appboard Application Board
  The Application Board adds a few more elements not available on the Controller Board.  The 
  DipSwitch (App Board v1.x only) provides a simple 8-channel switch for manual configuration,
  and the AppLed class represents the 4 LEDs on the Application Board.
  
  Also specific to the Application Board, the DigitalIn and DigitalOut systems make it easy to 
  control the 8 digital ins and outs on it.  These are based on the Io system, but take care of
  some configuration for you.
