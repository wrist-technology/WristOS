/**
  Listen for incoming TCP connections.
  
  \section Usage
  To get started using a TcpServer, create a new TcpServer object, put it in listen mode and
  start accepting requests.  The TcpServer will accept one client after another, blocking
  until a new client makes a connection.
  
  \code
  void myTask(void* p)
  {
    TcpServer server; // create the server
    server.listen(8080); // put it into listen mode on port 8080
    // now in our loop, wait for new connections, say hello to each of them, and close them
    while(1)
    {
      TcpSocket* client = server.accept(); // this will wait for new connections to come in
      if(client) // if we got a good connection
      {
        client->write("hello there", 11);
        client->close();
        delete client;
      }
      Task::sleep(2);
    }
  }
  \endcode
  
  If you're looking to serve HTTP requests check the WebServer instead, which is built on
  the TcpServer.
