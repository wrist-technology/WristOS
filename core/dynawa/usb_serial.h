/**
  Virutal serial port USB communication.
  This allows the Make Controller look like a serial modem to your desktop, which it can then easily
  open up, read and write to.
  
  \section Usage
  There's only one UsbSerial object in the system, so you never create your own.  You can access
  it through the get() method.
  
  \code
  UsbSerial* usb = UsbSerial::get(); // first get a reference to the central UsbSerial object
  usb->write("hello", 5); // write a little something
  
  char buffer[128];
  int got = usb->read(buffer, 128); // and read
  \endcode
  
  \section Drivers
  On OS X, the system driver is used - no external drivers are needed.
  An entry in \b /dev is created - similar to <b>/dev/cu.usbmodem.xxxx</b>.  It may be opened for reading and 
  writing like a regular file using the standard POSIX open(), close(), read(), write() functions.

  On Windows, the first time the device is seen, it needs 
  to be pointed to a .INF file containing additional information - the \b make_controller_kit.inf in 
  the same directory as this file.  Once Windows sets this up, the device can be opened as a normal
  COM port.  If you've installed mchelper or mcbuilder, this file is already in the right spot
  on your system.
