/**
  Read and write Ethernet data via UDP.
  UDP is a lightweight network protocol that's great for sending lots of data
  at quick rates.  Unlike TcpSocket you're not always guaranteed that each and every message
  you send will ultimately reach its destination, but the ones that do will get there very quickly.
  
  \section Usage
  To get started with a UdpSocket, create a new UdpSocket object.  If you're only going to be 
  writing, all you need is the write() method.  If you're reading, first call bind() to bind to
  a given port, and then read() from it as desired.
  
  \code
  UdpSocket sock; // create a new socket
  sock.write("hi there", strlen("hi there"), IP_ADDRESS(192,168,0,5), 10000); // can write immediately
  if(sock.bind(10000))
  {
    char buffer[128];
    int bytes_read = sock.read(buffer, 128); // this will wait for data to show up
    if(bytes_read) // did we read successfully?
    {
      // ...handle new data here...
    }
  }
  \endcode
