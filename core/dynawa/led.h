/**
  Controls the single green LED on the MAKE Controller Board.
  There are two LEDs on the MAKE Controller Board - one green and one red.  The red LED is simply
  a power indicator and cannot be controlled by the Controller.  The green LED can be used for
  program feedback.  In many MakingThings applications, for example, it is set to blink once a
  second, showing the board's "heartbeat" and letting the user know that the board is running.
  
  If you're looking to control the LEDs on the Application Board, check \ref AppLed.
