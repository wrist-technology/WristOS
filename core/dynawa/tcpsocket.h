/**
  Read and write Ethernet data via TCP.
  TCP is a reliable way to transfer information via Ethernet.
  
  \section Usage
  There are a couple typical ways you might get a TcpSocket - you might simply create
  one yourself, or you might receive one from a TcpServer listening for incoming connections.
  If you're creating one yourself, you can use the connect() method to connect to other
  listening sockets, then read() and write() as you like.  You can always check the number
  of bytes available to be read with bytesAvailable().
  
  \code
  // Making a connection ourselves
  TcpSocket socket;
  char buffer[512]; // buffer to read into
  if( socket.connect(IP_ADDRESS(192,168,0,100), 10100)) // connect to 
  {
    socket.write("hi", 2);
    int available = socket.bytesAvailable();
    if( available > 0) // is there anything to read?
    {
      if(available > 512) // only read as much as we have room for
        available = 512;
      socket.read(buffer, available);  // read everything available into our buffer
    }
    socket.close(); // always remember to close it if connect() was successful
  }
  \endcode
  
  Note that you don't need to destroy a socket each time you connect and disconnect with it.
  You can call connect() and close() in succession as many times as you like.
  
  If you're looking to make connections to web servers check the WebClient instead, which
  builds on top of TcpSocket.
