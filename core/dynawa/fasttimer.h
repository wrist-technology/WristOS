/**
  Provides a high resolution timer in a microsecond context.
  
  \section usage Usage
  The interface for the FastTimer is essentially the same as the \ref Timer system, so 
  that's the best place to check for an overview.  

  \section notes Notes
  A few things to be aware of when using FastTimers:
  - In your handler, you must not sleep or make any calls that will take a long time.  You may, however, use
  the Queue and Semaphore calls that end in \b fromISR in order to synchronize with running tasks.
  - To modify an existing FastTimer, stop() it and then start() it again.  Modifying it while running is not recommended.
  - There are 3 identical hardware timers on the Make Controller.  The first FastTimer that you create
  will specify which of them to use, and it will be used for all subsequent fast timers created.  
  If you don't specify a channel, 2 is used which is usually fine.  Specifically, the \ref Timer is on 
  channel 0 by default, so make sure to keep them separate if you're running them at the same time.
  - if you have lots of FastTimers, the timing can start to get a little jittery.  For instance, the \ref Servo and \ref Stepper
  libraries use the FastTimer and they can become a little unstable if too many of them are running at once.
