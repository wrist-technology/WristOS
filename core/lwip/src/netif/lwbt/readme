INTRODUCTION

lwBT is a small implementation of the Bluetooth protocol suite developed 
by Conny Ohult while at Embedded Systems Internet (EIS) lab at Luleå 
University of Technology. 

lwBT is implemented to transport IP data over Bluetooth by acting as a 
network interface to lwIP, an open source implementation of the TCP/IP
protocol suite that was originally written by Adam Dunkels of the
Swedish Institute of Computer Science. As lwIP, the focus of the lwBT 
Bluetooth implementation is to reduce the RAM usage while still having 
a full scale Bluetooth. This making lwBT/lwIP suitable for use in 
embedded systems with tenths of kilobytes of free RAM and room for 
around 60 kilobytes of code ROM.

FEATURES

 * L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaption Protocol) for higher level 
   protocol multiplexing, packet segmentation. 
 * SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) including support for advertising 
   services in user defined records. 
 * RFCOMM protocol for serial port emulation. Defines a subset of the 
   ETSI TS 07.10 standard, with some Bluetooth-specific adaptations. 
 * PPP (Point to Point Protocol) including support for IPCP. 
 * HCI (Host Controller Interface) for optionally providing a uniform 
   interface method to access the lower layers of the Bluetooth Stack 
   when they are implemented in a Bluetooth host controller (often 
   referred to as a Bluetooth module). 
 * Sample LAN access point (LAP profile) and Data Terminal (LAP and 
   DUN profiles) control applications

DEVELOPMENT

Hopefully in the near future lwBT development is going to be hosted
by lwIP's site at Svannah.
