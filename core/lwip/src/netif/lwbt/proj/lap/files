bt_ip_lap.c - Sample LAP and DUN profile control application for the DT
              and LAP role. Initialises the Host Controller using HCI, 
	      and then finds and connects to a metwork access point.
	      After a network connection has been established it 
              initialises itself to become an LAN Access Point (LAP).
              The LAP uses NAT to assign private IP address to devices
              that connect. NAT then translates between the private
              network and the public network.
