/**
  Helper class to respond to WebServer requests.
  To respond to requests from the WebSever, subclass WebResponder and re-implement the 
  methods need for your application.
  
  \section Usage
  The WebServer will call your responder when it receives a request whose first element 
  matches the name returned by address().  So if the request looked like <b>192.168.0.200/monkey/yak/tuba</b>
  the WebServer will call the WebResponder whose address() method returns "monkey".
  
  Depending on the type of request, the WebServer will call one of 4 methods, get(), put(), post(), del(),
  which correspond to the main HTTP verbs.  Web browsers send GET requests when they ask to view 
  a page, so that's the most common type, but other applications may require the other methods as well.
  
  To respond, your first call should be to setResponseCode() and then 1 or more calls to addHeader().  
  After that, write out whatever data you like in the body via the \ref response socket and you're all set.  
  Remember that you can write it out a chunk at a time - you don't need to send it all at once.  
  If you have responded to a request, return true from your handler and the WebServer will stop 
  processing the request.  Otherwise, it will continue to look for other responders.
  
  For more info about HTTP, check the Wikipedia article - 
  
  Here's a very simple example of a class that inherits from WebResponder and get respond to HTTP
  GET requests:
  \code
  class MyResponder : public WebResponder // inherit from WebResponder
  {
    public:
      const char* address()
      {
        return "myresponder"; // match all requests that start with "/myresponder"
      }
      // in this simple example, we only ever care about HTTP GETs,
      bool get( char* path ) // so that's the only one we implement
      {
        setResponseCode(200); // everything's OK
        addHeader("Content-type", "text/plain"); // just sending some text back
        if( strcmp(path, "/myresponder/test") == 0 ) // check the path to see what was requested
          response->write("here's a response", strlen("here's a response")); // the actual text
        else
          response->write("unknown path", strlen("unknown path"));
        return true; // indicate that we responded and 
      }
  };
  \endcode
