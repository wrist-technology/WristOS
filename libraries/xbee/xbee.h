/**
  Communicate with XBee (Zigbee) wireless modules via the Make Controller's serial port.

  XBee modules from \b MaxStream are small, cheap ($19 each), wireless \b RF (radio frequency) modules that
  can easily be used with the Make Controller Kit to create projects that require wireless communication.  Check
  http://www.maxstream.net/products/xbee/xbee-oem-rf-module-zigbee.php for more info.

  \section Overview
  XBee modules are <b>ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4</b> compliant and can operate in several modes:
  - Transparent serial port.  Messages in one side magically end up at the other endpoint.  Great for enabling wireless
  communication between 2 Make Controllers.
  - AT command mode.  Send traditional AT commands to configure the module itself (as opposed to having
  the data go straight through via serial mode.
  - Packet (API) mode.  Lower level communication that doesn't have to wait for the module to be in
  AT command mode.  Check the \ref XBeePacketTypes for a description of how these packets are laid out.  
  Be sure to call setPacketApiMode() before trying to do anything in this mode.
  
  \section Usage
  The general idea is that you have one XBee module connected directly to your Make Controller Kit, and then
  any number of other XBee modules that can communicate with it in order to get information to and from the
  Make Controller.  Or, several Make Controllers can each have an XBee module connected in order to
  communicate wirelessly among themselves.

  XBee modules also have some digital and analog I/O right on them, which means you can directly connect
  sensors to the XBee modules which will both read the values and send them wirelessly.  Check the XBee doc
  for the appropriate commands to send in order to set this up.
  
  To get started, create an XBeePacket object and start reading & writing with it.  \b Note - this system is
  designed to reuse an existing XBeePacket object, as opposed to making a new one each read/write.  Calling reset()
  between operations will clear everything out.
  
  Once you've received a packet, you can extract the details with unpackRX16(), unpackRX64(), 
  unpackIO16() and unpackIO64(), depending on the type of packet.  To create a new packet to send out, use
  tx16(), tx64(), and atCmd() depending on the kind of message you want to send.
  
  \b Example
  \code
  XBeePacket xb; // create our object
  xb.setPacketApiMode(true); // turn on packet mode - always do this first
  
  while(true) // forever...assuming we're in a task loop here
  {
    if(xb.get())
    {
      // ... process the newly received packet here
      if(xb.type() == XBEE_RX16) // check what kind of packet it is
      {
        uint16 source;  // variable to read the source address into
        uint8 strength; // variable to read the signal strength into
        xb.unpackRX16( &source, &strength );
        // now source and strength are set to the values received in our packet
        // ... do something here if you like depending on what we got ...
      }
      xb.reset(); // and reset it before our next round through the loop
    }
    Task::sleep(5); // always sleep a little bit in our loop
  }
  \endcode

  \section serialmode Serial Mode
  The Make Controller API for working with the XBee modules makes use of the XBee Packet API.  If you simply want to make use
  of the transparent serial port functionality, you can just use the Serial port directly.

  Bytes sent in this way are broadcast to all XBee modules on the same chanel and with the same PAN ID.  All similarly
  configured modules will receive all bytes sent.  However, because these bytes are broadcast, there is no message
  reliability, so there's no guarantee that the messages will actually get there.
  
  \section packetapimode Packet API Mode
  The XBee Packet API allows for much more flexible and powerful communication with the modules.  With the Packet API
  you can address messages to a specific module, detect where messages came from, check signal strength, and
  packets are sent with a send / acknowledges / retry scheme which greatly increases message reliability.

  The packet API uses commands to configure the XBee module itself, and then a handful of Zigbee specified packet types can be sent and received.  
  See \ref XBeePacketTypes for details on these packet types.
