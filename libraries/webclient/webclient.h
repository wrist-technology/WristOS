  Connect to sites and other services on the internet or local network via HTTP.

  The web client system allows the Make Controller to get/post data to a webserver.  This
  makes it straightforward to use the Make Controller as a source of data for your web apps.
  
  Note that these functions make liberal use of printf-style functions, which can require 
  lots of memory to be allocated to the task calling them.
