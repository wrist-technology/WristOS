/**
  Encrypt and decrypt data using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

  AES is a block cipher adopted for use by the NSA (US government agency).  According to Wikipedia,
  "This marks the first time the public has had access to a cipher approved by the NSA for
  top secret information."  Pretty cool, right?  This is a good way to send info privately
  from your Make Controller over the network, to a web server for example.

  AES requires that both sides of communication have access to the same key.  So both your Make 
  Controller, and whatever other device it's communicating with need to know about the same 
  password so they can decrypt data that has been encrypted by the other.

  There are several different flavors of AES.  There are two main ways in which AES libraries
  differ:
  - the way they chain blocks
  - the way they pad data

  This library uses ECB (Electronic Code Book) chaining, and pads data with a character 
  that corresponds to the number of bytes needed to pad to 16.  Check the Wikipedia article
  for an explanation - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard

  The lookup tables used in this library will use somewhere between 8 and 13 kB of program space, 
  depending on the compiler optimization you use.  Memory usage is pretty minimal.

  Code is used and adapted from Philip J. Erdelsky - see http://www.efgh.com/software/rijndael.htm
  for the original.
